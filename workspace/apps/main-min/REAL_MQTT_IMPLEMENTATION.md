# Real WiFi and MQTT Implementation - main-min

## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

The main-min application has been successfully transformed from simulation to **REAL WiFi and MQTT publishing**.

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `embassy-net` - Network stack for real connectivity
- `smoltcp` - TCP/IP stack
- `esp-wifi` - ESP32-C3 WiFi drivers
- `embassy-futures` - Async utilities
- `embedded-io-async` - Async I/O traits
- `serde` and `serde-json-core` - JSON serialization

### 2. Hardware Initialization
- Real WiFi hardware initialization (TIMG0, WIFI, RNG peripherals)
- Network stack creation with DHCP configuration
- Socket storage allocation for network operations

### 3. Real WiFi Manager
- Loads WiFi credentials from iot-config or environment variables
- Creates real WiFi controller with connection management
- Automatic reconnection on disconnection
- Status monitoring and reporting

### 4. Real MQTT Manager
- Network stack integration for real socket operations
- Real MQTT broker connection (not simulation)
- Actual packet transmission over WiFi
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

## Expected RTT Output

When running the real implementation, you should see:

```
[WIFI-MIN] Starting REAL WiFi connectivity...
[WIFI-MIN] ‚úì Loaded WiFi config from iot-config
[WIFI-MIN] SSID: YourNetworkName
[WIFI-MIN] WiFi configuration set
[WIFI-MIN] WiFi controller started
[WIFI-MIN] Attempting WiFi connection...
[WIFI-MIN] ‚úì WiFi connected successfully!

## Key Differences from Simulation

| Aspect | Before (Simulation) | After (Real) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| WiFi | `"simulation mode"` | Real WiFi controller with credentials |
| Network | No network stack | Full embassy-net stack with DHCP |
| MQTT | `"SIMULATION: Would create packet"` | `"REAL: MQTT PUBLISH packet sent"` |
| Broker | No connection | Actual TCP socket to broker |
| Messages | Mock packet structure | Real packets over WiFi |

## MQTT Broker Verification

On your MQTT broker (10.10.10.210), you should now see:

```bash
# mosquitto_sub -h 10.10.10.210 -t "esp32/heartbeat" -v
esp32/heartbeat ping
esp32/heartbeat ping
esp32/heartbeat ping
```

## Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build the real implementation
cargo build --release --features mqtt

# Flash to ESP32-C3
cargo run --release --features mqtt
```

## Network Requirements

- WiFi network configured in iot-config JSON or environment variables
- MQTT broker accessible on the network
- ESP32-C3 has network connectivity

The implementation maintains all the excellent debugging output while providing real network functionality.
