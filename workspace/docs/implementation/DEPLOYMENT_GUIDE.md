```

## Production Monitoring and Maintenance

### Operational Monitoring

#### Real-Time System Monitoring

**MQTT Message Monitoring:**
```bash
# Comprehensive message monitoring
mosquitto_sub -h 10.10.10.210 -t "esp32c3/+/+/+" -v | while read line; do
    echo "$(date): $line" >> /var/log/iot-monitoring.log
done

# Automated alert system for missing messages
#!/bin/bash
LAST_MESSAGE=$(tail -1 /var/log/iot-monitoring.log | cut -d':' -f1-3)
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
TIME_DIFF=$(( $(date -d"$CURRENT_TIME" +%s) - $(date -d"$LAST_MESSAGE" +%s) ))

if [ $TIME_DIFF -gt 60 ]; then
    echo "ALERT: No messages received for $TIME_DIFF seconds"
    # Send alert to monitoring system
fi
```

#### Performance Monitoring (main-app)

**Performance Metrics Collection:**
```bash
# Extract performance metrics from RTT output
espmonitor /dev/ttyACM0 | grep "\\[PERF\\]" | while read line; do
    echo "$(date): $line" >> /var/log/performance-monitoring.log
done

# Automated performance analysis
#!/bin/bash
# Performance threshold monitoring
tail -100 /var/log/performance-monitoring.log | grep "Sensor average" | while read line; do
    TIMING=$(echo $line | sed 's/.*: \\([0-9]*\\)μs.*/\\1/')
    if [ $TIMING -gt 500 ]; then
        echo "PERFORMANCE ALERT: Sensor timing $TIMING μs exceeds 500μs threshold"
    fi
done
```

### Maintenance Procedures

```

## Scaling and Expansion

### Large-Scale Deployment

#### Device Provisioning

**Automated Device Configuration:**
```python
# Device provisioning script
import serial
import time
import json

class DeviceProvisioner:
    def __init__(self, config_template):
        self.config_template = config_template
    
    def provision_device(self, serial_port, device_id):
        # Generate device-specific configuration
        config = self.config_template.copy()
        config['device_id'] = device_id
        config['mqtt']['client_id'] = f"esp32-c3-{device_id}"
        
        # Flash firmware with configuration
        self.flash_firmware(serial_port, config)
        
        # Verify deployment
        return self.verify_device(device_id)

# Usage for batch provisioning
provisioner = DeviceProvisioner(base_config)
for device_id in range(100, 200):
    result = provisioner.provision_device(f"/dev/ttyUSB{device_id-100}", device_id)
    print(f"Device {device_id}: {'SUCCESS' if result else 'FAILED'}")
```

#### Infrastructure Scaling

**MQTT Broker Clustering:**
```yaml
# Docker Compose for HiveMQ cluster
version: '3.8'
services:
  hivemq-1:
    image: hivemq/hivemq4
    environment:
      - HIVEMQ_CLUSTER_NODE_ID=node-1
      - HIVEMQ_CLUSTER_TRANSPORT_TYPE=TCP
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
      - "8080:8080"
  
  hivemq-2:
    image: hivemq/hivemq4
    environment:
      - HIVEMQ_CLUSTER_NODE_ID=node-2
      - HIVEMQ_CLUSTER_TRANSPORT_TYPE=TCP
    depends_on:
      - hivemq-1
```

### Multi-Platform Expansion

#### Hardware Platform Support

**Platform Abstraction enables multi-platform support:**
```rust
// Platform abstraction framework
pub trait HardwarePlatform {
    type GpioInterface: GpioInterface;
    type TimerInterface: TimerInterface;
    type I2cInterface: I2cInterface;
    
    fn get_gpio(&mut self) -> Self::GpioInterface;
    fn get_timer(&self) -> Self::TimerInterface;
    fn get_i2c(&mut self) -> Self::I2cInterface;
}

// Multi-platform implementations
impl HardwarePlatform for ESP32C3Platform { /* ESP32-C3 implementation */ }
