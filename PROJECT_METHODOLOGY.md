#### Module Organization Principles

**1. Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clearly defined purpose
**2. Clear Dependencies**: Dependencies flow from apps → core → drivers
**3. Self-Contained**: Each module includes all necessary documentation and tests
**4. Consistent Structure**: All modules follow the same internal organization
**5. Explicit Interfaces**: Clear API boundaries with comprehensive documentation

### File Organization Standards

#### Naming Conventions

**Directories**: `kebab-case` (e.g., `iot-common`, `main-app`)
**Rust Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `sensor_manager.rs`, `mqtt_client.rs`)
**Configuration Files**: `kebab-case.extension` (e.g., `cargo-config.toml`)
**Documentation Files**: `UPPER_CASE.md` (e.g., `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
**Scripts**: `snake_case.extension` (e.g., `build_test_all.py`, `validate_hardware.sh`)

#### Content-Based Organization

**Source Code**: `/src/` directory with logical module grouping
**Tests**: `/tests/` directory with comprehensive test coverage
**Examples**: `/examples/` directory with practical usage demonstrations
**Documentation**: `/docs/` directory with technical and architectural documentation
**Configuration**: `/config/` directory with environment-specific configurations
**Scripts**: `/scripts/` directory with categorized automation tools
